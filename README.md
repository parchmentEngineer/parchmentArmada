# The Parchment Armada
A mod for Cobalt Core that adds brand new ships to change up how you play the game! Currently adds two ships - the Trinity and the Eris - with plans for more on the way.

# Eris

With a -1 damage modifier on all attacks, the Eris will primarially rely on its signature Strife Drones for attack. These drones function as powerful damage multipliers, causing any attacks that strike them to become amplified and last over multiple turns. Beware, however - enemy attacks that hit Strife Drones will recieve these same benefits, turning every drone into a potential threat.

# Trinity

The Trinity is a reactive ship, whose true power is only revealed after taking a hit. Every time a cannon is struck by an attack, it becomes active until the end of your turn, potentially doubling or tripling your damage. If that isn't enough, it draws one additional card each turn, and starts with three Assault Bracing cards to manually activate cannons when needed.
