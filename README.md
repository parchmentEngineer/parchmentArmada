# The Parchment Armada
A mod for Cobalt Core that adds brand new ships to change up how you play the game! Currently adds four ships - the Eris, the Helios, the Proteus, and the Trinity.

# Eris

With a -1 damage modifier on all attacks, the Eris will primarially rely on its signature Strife Drones for attack. These drones function as powerful damage multipliers, causing any attacks that strike them to become amplified and last over multiple turns. Beware, however - enemy attacks that hit Strife Drones will recieve these same benefits, turning every drone into a potential threat.

# Helios

Whenever you play the center card of your hand while piloting this ship, you instantly redirect all remaining energy into the solar cannon at the heart of this ship. Do so enough times, and the cannon will fire a devestating blast. Knowing when to play your cards for their effect and when to charge the solar cannon is the key to success.

# Proteus

This pecuiular craft is composed of a swarm of ever-shifting nanobots. Each turn, one of your parts will be replaced by a new ship part, and by playing your cards carefully you can control what position the new part will be inserted into. In addition to the standard ship parts, the Proteus also has access to a variety of new fuel tanks, thrusters, and other components that will give it an edge.

# Trinity

The Trinity is a reactive ship, whose true power is only revealed after taking a hit. Every time a cannon is struck by an attack, it becomes active until the end of your turn, potentially doubling or tripling your damage. If that isn't enough, it draws one additional card each turn, and starts with three Assault Bracing cards to manually activate cannons when needed.
